# blogcms-api

Cms-api is an app built with Express which serves content for blogcms-admin and blogcms-client and accept user data (ie new blog post/comments) and persist in database. It implements REST API for external application (CORS white listed domain) to interact with it.


It is part of the headless cms system.

Headless blog CMS has an express server (api) that serves content, a Vue app (client) for rendering content and a React app (admin) for managing the content in the server (ie blog posts and comments). The system is communicating using REST API calls over HTTP.
